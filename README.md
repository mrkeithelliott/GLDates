## Requirements

* A version of [Xcode][xcode] (7.x) capable of building the project you wish to document.
* iOS 8.x, Swift 1.2 or 2.0

##Installation

####[Carthage](http://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
```ruby 
github "mrkeithelliott/GLDates" ~> 0.1
```

## Usage
####Import `GLDates` module
```swift
import GLDates
```

#### Getting yesterday
```swift
let yesterday = NSDate.yesterday()   
```

#### Date operations
```swift
// Getting Last Year
let today = NSDate()
let lastYear = today.previousDate(1, monthsBack: 0, daysBack: 0)
```

```swift
// Getting Last month
let lastMonth = today.previousDate(0, monthsBack: 1, daysBack: 0)
```
```swift
// Getting the first day of the month
let firstOfMonth = NSDate().firstOfMonth()
```

```swift
// Getting the last day of the month, given a starting date
let lastDayOfCurrentMonth = today.lastDayOfMonth()
let lastDayOfLastMonth = lastMonth.lastDayOfMonth()
```

```swift
// Getting the first day of the year
let firstOfYear = lastYear.firstOfYear()
```

```swift
// Getting the last day of the year
let lastDayOfCurrentYear = today.lastDayOfYear()
let lastDayOfLastYear = lastYear.lastDayOfYear()
```
#### Social Date Formatting

```swift
 let _5hours: NSTimeInterval = Double(60 * 60 * -5)
        
 var date = NSDate(timeInterval: _5hours, sinceDate: today)
 var dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
 // prints "5 hours ago"
```

```swift
let _4hours: NSTimeInterval = Double(60 * 60 * -4)
date = NSDate(timeInterval:_4hours, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "4 hours ago"
```

```swift
let _10hours: NSTimeInterval = Double(60 * 60 * -10)
date = NSDate(timeInterval:_10hours, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "today"
```

```swift
let _30mins: NSTimeInterval = Double(60 * -30)
date = NSDate(timeInterval: _30mins, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "30 mins ago"
```

```swift
let _30seconds: NSTimeInterval = Double(-30)
date = NSDate(timeInterval:_30seconds, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "30 seconds ago"
```

```swift
let _5seconds: NSTimeInterval = Double(-5)
date = NSDate(timeInterval:_5seconds, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "moments ago"
```
