# GLDates ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg) 
GLDates is a small library of date utilities written in Swift to handle several of the common date operations.  It is implemented as an extension on NSDate.

## Requirements

* A version of [Xcode][xcode] (7.x) capable of building the project you wish to document.
* iOS 8.x, Swift 1.2 or 2.0

##Installation

####[Carthage](http://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
```ruby 
github "mrkeithelliott/GLDates" ~> 0.2
```

## Usage
####Import `GLDates` module
```swift
import GLDates
```
#### Date operations
```swift
// Getting yesterday
let yesterday = NSDate.yesterday()   
```

```swift
// Getting Last Year
let today = NSDate()
let lastYear = today.previousDate(1, monthsBack: 0, daysBack: 0)
```

```swift
// Getting Last month
let lastMonth = today.previousDate(0, monthsBack: 1, daysBack: 0)
```
```swift
// Getting the first day of the month
let firstOfMonth = NSDate().firstOfMonth()
```

```swift
// Getting the last day of the month, given a starting date
let lastDayOfCurrentMonth = today.lastDayOfMonth()
let lastDayOfLastMonth = lastMonth.lastDayOfMonth()
```

```swift
// Getting the first day of the year
let firstOfYear = lastYear.firstOfYear()
```

```swift
// Getting the last day of the year
let lastDayOfCurrentYear = today.lastDayOfYear()
let lastDayOfLastYear = lastYear.lastDayOfYear()
```
#### Social Date Formatting

```swift
 let _5hours: NSTimeInterval = Double(60 * 60 * -5)
        
 var date = NSDate(timeInterval: _5hours, sinceDate: today)
 var dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
 // prints "5 hours ago"
```

```swift
let _10hours: NSTimeInterval = Double(60 * 60 * -10)
date = NSDate(timeInterval:_10hours, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "today"
```

```swift
let _30mins: NSTimeInterval = Double(60 * -30)
date = NSDate(timeInterval: _30mins, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "30 mins ago"
```

```swift
let _30seconds: NSTimeInterval = Double(-30)
date = NSDate(timeInterval:_30seconds, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "30 seconds ago"
```

```swift
let _5seconds: NSTimeInterval = Double(-5)
date = NSDate(timeInterval:_5seconds, sinceDate: today)
dateString = date.formattedSocialTime()
// prints "moments ago"
```

#### Finding the Next Date Using Patterns
You can use:
```swift
func nextDateSkippingDays(daysBetween: Int, currentDate: NSDate)->NSDate
```
on an NSDate to find the next date that is closes to the passed in current date, while adhering to a repeat policy.  For example, if you have a repeating date from last month (repeats every 3 days) and you want to find the date that is closest to the current date while following the repeating schedule, you can accomplish this with the nextDateSkippingDays()

There are also methods that will allow you to skip weeks and months to accomplish similar tasks.
```swift
func nextDateSkippingWeeks(weeksBetween: Int, currentDate: NSDate)->NSDate
func nextDateSkippingMonths(monthsBetween: Int, currentDate: NSDate)->NSDate
```

Another series of methods will return you the array of dates that follow the pattern from the initial date up to the closest date passed in as the current date.
```swift
func getDatesSkippingDays(daysBetween: Int, currentDate: NSDate, currentlist: [NSDate]? = nil)->[NSDate]?
func getDatesSkippingWeeks(weeksBetween: Int, currentDate: NSDate, currentlist: [NSDate]? = nil)->[NSDate]?
func getDatesSkippingMonths(monthsBetween: Int, currentDate: NSDate, currentlist: [NSDate]? = nil)->[NSDate]?
```

Example Usage
```swift
let today = NSDate()
today.dateWithNoTime()
//prints "Jan 8, 2016, 12:00 AM"

let cal = NSCalendar.currentCalendar()
let _5daysAgo = cal.dateByAddingUnit(.Day, value: -5, toDate: today, options: .MatchStrictly)
// prints "Jan 3, 2016, 9:15 AM"

let nextDate = _5daysAgo!.nextDateSkippingDays(2, currentDate: today)
// prints "Jan 9, 2016, 12:00 AM"

let nextDates = _5daysAgo!.getDatesSkippingDays(2, currentDate: today)
// prints [["Jan 5, 2016, 12:00 AM", "Jan 7, 2016, 12:00 AM"]
```
